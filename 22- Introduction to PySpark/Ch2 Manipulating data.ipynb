    "In this chapter, you'll learn how to use the methods defined by Spark's `DataFrame` class to perform common data operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at performing column-wise operations. In Spark you can do this using the `.withColumn()` method, which takes two arguments. First, a string with the name of your new column, and second the new column itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new column must be an object of class `Column`. Creating one of these is as easy as extracting a column from your DataFrame using `df.colName`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Updating a Spark DataFrame is somewhat different than working in `pandas` because the Spark DataFrame is immutable. This means that it can't be changed, and so columns can't be updated in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, all these methods return a new DataFrame. To overwrite the original DataFrame you must reassign the returned DataFrame using the method like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "> df = df.withColumn(\"newCol\", df.oldCol + 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code creates a DataFrame with the same columns as `df` plus a new column, `newCol`, where every entry is equal to the corresponding entry from `oldCol`, plus one.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overwrite an existing column, just pass the name of the column as the first argument!\n",

    "A SQL query returns a table derived from one or more tables contained in a database.\n",

    "The SELECT command is followed by the columns you want in the resulting table.\n",

The .`filter()` method takes either an expression that would follow the WHERE clause of a SQL expression as a string, or a Spark Column of boolean (`True`/`False`) values.\n",

Spark's .`filter()` can accept any expression that could go in the `WHERE`clause of a SQL query (in this case, `\"air_time > 120\"`), as long as it is passed as a string. Notice that in this case, we do not reference the name of the table in the string -- as we wouldn't in the SQL request.\n",
    "\n",
