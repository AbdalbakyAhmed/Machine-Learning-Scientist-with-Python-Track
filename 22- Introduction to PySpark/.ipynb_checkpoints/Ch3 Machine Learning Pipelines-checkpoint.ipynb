But you'll also be using the airline and the plane's destination as features in your model. These are coded as strings and there isn't any obvious way to convert them to a numeric data type.\n",

    "Fortunately, PySpark has functions for handling this built into the `pyspark.ml.features submodule`. You can create what are called 'one-hot vectors' to represent the carrier and the destination of each flight.

    "The first step to encoding your categorical feature is to create a `StringIndexer`. Members of this class are `Estimator`s that take a DataFrame with a column of strings and map each unique string to a number. Then, the `Estimator` returns a `Transformer` that takes a DataFrame, attaches the mapping to it as metadata, and returns a new DataFrame with a numeric column corresponding to the string column.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is to encode this numeric column as a one-hot vector using a `OneHotEncoder`. This works exactly the same way as the `StringIndexer` by creating an `Estimator` and then a `Transformer`. The end result is a column that encodes your categorical feature as a vector that's suitable for machine learning routines!\n",
